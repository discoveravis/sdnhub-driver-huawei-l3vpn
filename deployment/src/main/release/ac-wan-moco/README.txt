Introduction
============

This guide helps to setup the moco server for AC-WAN Controller to learn
the REST API supported by l3-vpn driver service.

Configuration of the Mocked AC-WAN Controller environment[edit]

1. Install the moco standalone server by following the steps given at https://github.com/dreamhead/moco/blob/master/moco-doc/usage.md#shell

2. Run the moco server using following command to mock the AC-WAN Controller:

             java -jar moco-runner-0.11.0-standalone.jar https -p 18008 -c acwancontroller.json -https cert.jks -cert mocohttps --keystore mocohttps

    acwancontroller.json file can be found in sample-api-usage: https://gerrit.open-o.org/r/#/c/4093/
    cert.jks can be downloaded from here : https://github.com/dreamhead/moco/tree/master/moco-runner/src/test/resources/certificate

    Please note down the shutdown port reported in console when moco server started. And use that port to shutdown the server as below:
  
         moco shutdown -p <shutdown port number>

    Now controller is up. Following is the example to access the api:
	
	https://127.0.0.1:18008/restconf/config/huawei-ac-net-l3vpn:l3vpn-cfg/instances/instance/123
	Method: GET
	HEADER: Content-Type: application/json

3. Add AC-WAN to ESR service by using below sample json (please refer http://wiki.open-o.org , on how to register AC-WAN controller using ESR)

{
   "name": "ACWANController",
   "vendor": "Huawei",
   "version": "V300R001C00",
   "description": "",
   "type": "Agile Controller-WAN",
   "url": "https://192.168.4.161:18008",
   "userName": "operator",
   "password": "operator",
   "productName": "AC-WAN",
   "protocol": "restconf"
 }
 
 4. For each REST API supported by l3-vpn driver services, corresponding samples request and response details are provided under the folder 'sample-api-usage'.

For each REST API supported by l3-vpn driver services, corresponding samples
request and response details are provided under the folder 'sample-api-usage'

To test the REST API, either postman or curl command could be used. Before testing,
update the header "X-Driver-Parameter": "extSysID=<VIM ID generated by ESR>" and
use the JSON body as it is.
